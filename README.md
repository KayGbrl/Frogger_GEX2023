# Executive Summary

Frogger is a classic arcade action game from the 80s and is a lot of fun for young and old! 
The game is self-explanatory to the user; you take control of a frog and need to jump across a 
road; after the road, the player must cross a river and try not to fall.

The player must avoid cars and trucks in the first part of the map. Getting hit by one of them 
results in a reset and a loss of lives. The second part is as hard as the first, crossing the river by 
jumping on logs, but donâ€™t jump on the crocodile or into the water to not lose another life.

# Game Description

## Overview

The game is played in a top-down view and is divided into two areas. The first area is a busy 
road filled with cars and trucks, which must be avoided by the player (frog). You can only jump 
one tile at once and reach the river-safe area where you can relax for a few seconds.
The river is filled with logs the frog must jump on, but do not jump into the water or on a 
crocodile. Doing that results in a reset, and you will have to start from the beginning and lose 
life.
The player has three lives. A life is lost if the player gets hit by a car or truck, jumps into the 
water, or jumps on a crocodile, if the player loses all their lives the game is over.
The player has three lives. A life is lost if the player gets hit by a car or truck, jumps into the water, or jumps on a crocodile, if the player loses all their lives the game is over. 
The player can pick up two different items such as double speed which speeds up the cars, trucks and the crocodile the other item is a health item to restore one live.

## Opponents

The opponents in Frogger are simple. You have six diverse types of opponents in this game.\
One opponent is a car that is driving on the road at the start of the level in random order.\
The second opponent is a truck that is also driving on the road at the start in random order.
Both the car and the truck can crush Frogger and result in a loss of life.\
The third opponent is a crocodile swimming in the river randomly, so watch out before 
jumping and be aware that the crocodile can appear at one of the safe spots.\
The fourth opponent can be the logs swimming in the river. You can jump on them, but do not
let them move outside the view while you are on them. If it happens, you lose your life.\
The fith opponent is a turtle which dives and only if it dives it is an threat.\
The sixth opponent is a snake which appears in the "safe" area between the road and the river.\
The last "opponent" is a timer running down, hurry up getting home!

## Environment

The world of Frogger is a mix of urban (road) and natural (river) environments, all this in a retro 
pixel style. 
The lower part is the road with four or five lanes to cross. The middle part is one tile big from left to 
right, where the player can be safe for a few seconds. The upper part is the river which has 
four or five lanes to cross. The last part at the top of the level is the finished space. Getting 
there will end the game, and the player has won.
